# [CSSBattle Solutions]

<a href="https://cssbattle.dev/">CSSBattle.dev</a> is a coding game that challenges players to visually match a target image using HTML and CSS.

Points are awarded based on exactly matching the target image, as well
as minimizing the number of characters used to solve each problem.

My solutions disregard minimizing character count.</b> I enjoyed
matching the HTML/CSS, but wasnt interested in the competative
challenge of smallest solution.

This site was written to because I thought it would look cool to stack
them all together.

## Instructions
